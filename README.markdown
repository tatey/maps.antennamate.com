## Development

First, start the local server and rebuild on change.

    $ script/serve

Then, open in your browser.

    $ open http://localhost:4000

The site is built into `tmp/site`.

## Testing

Run the entire test suite.

    $ script/spec

Specs are located in `spec/unit`.

## Deploying

First, configure S3 bucket credentials by editing
`config/s3_credentials.yml`.

    $ cp config/s3_credentials.dist.yml config/s3_credentials.yml.

Then, build and deploy to S3.

    $ script/deploy

The site is built into `tmp/deploy`. The directory is deleted before
building by the deploy script. Assets are minified.

Finally, everything is accelerated through Cloudfront for extra low-latency
goodness. HTTP headers can be configured by editing `config/s3_bucket.yml`.
